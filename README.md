# disjoint-synthetic-data-generation
 This repository holds our experiments with disjoint generation of synthetic tabular data. The idea is to generate parts of the full dataframe disjointly, and then recombine using joining rules, machine learning etc.

 Considering to use rpy2 to call R functions from Python. R installation required for synthpop to work!


 ## Useage Examples (Experiments in the Paper)
 
 Below is codebooks that can be used to replicate the results shown in the paper.
